# InsulinCalculator
Angel's simple HTML insulin calculator
When my daughter, Angel, was diagnosed with Type I diabetes, we had to learn quickly how insulin works. This calculator was built to track three carb ratios based on three primary meals a day. For a meal, provide the total carbs, the ratio and the current blood glucose level and the calculator will provide the number of whole units of insulin to inject. This calculator was only intended for Humalog (fast-acting insulin).

This app was originally compiled into an Android app with a JS-enabled WebView and sideloaded to my phone so I could get her units right.

I'd like to revisit this app in the future and expand its functionality.
